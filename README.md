# departure_board_v2
Departure board for any station in the V채sttrafik network

NOTICE:
This under construction project is based on an older API. 
This has recentry been changed, and I have not had the time to test it on the new API yet.


This app accesses the V채sttrafik API to generate a departure board for a chosen stop within the V채sttrafik network, and allows you to displyu the results in a web-app, using for example Uvicorn.
You must have a V채sttrafik developer avvount. Register for free here: https://developer.vasttrafik.se/

Gitignore:
